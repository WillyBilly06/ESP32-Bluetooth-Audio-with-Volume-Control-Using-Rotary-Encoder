# ESP32 Bluetooth Audio with Volume Control Using Rotary-Encoder
So I was just messing around with Phil Schatzmann's library and using Rotary Encoder which I accidently create a bluetooth device using Rotary Encoder to control the volume. Our device's volume will also update when we rotate the Rotary Encoder.

Also when the device is inactive for 1 minutes (changeable), it will go to deep sleep mode and to wake up the module, we need to pulldown PIN 15 of ESP32 to GND. You can change the auto shutdown time by changing the value of minutes in the code. 

Updated: It works on Android, IOS, and Samsung Watch (Wear OS but not sure Tizen OS). 

The built-in led of the board will be lit up when your phone is connected to the bluetooth. Also when you change the volume, the led on WS2812B will also lid up depends on the volume of the device, and the number of leds that will luminate is 10 (you can change it depend on your project)
